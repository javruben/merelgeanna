                <h2>What is hindsight valuation?</h2>
                
                <p>Wouldn't it be great if you really know what you are paying for? If your payment would be feedback, and would let the other know how you evaluate their services? Wouldn't it be great if everybody could enjoy good services, big or small, high income or low? For me, hindsight valuation is the answer to those questions.</p>
                <p>Working with hindsight valuation means that you will pay me after we have finished our project, training or coaching. There won’t be a fixed price: you will pay me what you think is fair, considering the added value my services has given to you. Working with hindsight valuation makes it very clear how you feel about my services, how you feel you have gained from them and where they have added value for you.</p>
                <p>As a trainer and coach, there is a shared responsibility in obtaining the goal you have set. We need to both be honest, committed and share responsibility for the outcome.</p>
                <p>Hindsight valuation will help you think about the added value and appreciate the work you and I have done.</p>
                <p>Trust, commitment, shared responsibility and honesty are important components of hindsight valuation and they are values I feel are crucial in my line of work. </p>
                <p>If you need help to decide what the added value of my services have been: Think about the value we’ve added, think about the time invested (other coaches charge between $75 and $400 per hour). We will talk about payment in our hindsight valuation conversation.</p>
                
                <h2>Pay-it-forward</h2>
                <p>If you are an individual who is looking for coaching but are not sure if you can afford it: I’d love to work with you on a pay-it-forward basis. This will imply investing personal time and effort into something profitable for our society. For more details and informations, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:Me@MerelGeanna.com">contact me</a> to discuss the matter further. I have a limited amount of coaching possibilities for pay-it-forward, so if you’re interested: <a href="mailto:Me@MerelGeanna.com">contact me!</a></p>
