                <h1>About me</h1>
                
                <p><img src="img/me.jpg" id="me" /> As a kind, energetic and unconditionally positive person, I focus on strengths and solutions to help individuals, teams and organizations discover, design and deliver their dreams.</p>
                
                <p>As an Appreciative Interventionist I work with individuals (coaching) and groups (training). I help them to intervene and create their dreams. I focus on strengths, solutions and appreciate what is already there. The methods I use are consistent with my outlook on life; methods such as appreciative inquiry, solution focussed brief therapy, positive psychology and a lot of creativity. I’m sure you will love it just as much as I do!</p>
                <p>I studied at the University of Amsterdam and hold a master's degree in social psychology as well as a master's degree in the science of communication. I’m a certified Interventionist from the Institute of Interventionism in the Netherlands. My studies provided a theoretical foundation to my belief in the power of teams. The magic of individuals working together, ‘in flow’, co-creating and reaching the most amazing goals is what ignites my passion for my work!</p>
                
                <p>I grew up in the Netherlands, spend some time in France and now enjoy living in San Francisco. Just as different countries have different cultures, so do organizations. I see it as an adventure to help organizations and the people who form them, by creating a culture that helps everybody to thrive.</p>
                
                <p>It’s my dream to live a happy, loving and fulfilling life, to make a blissful contribution to the world as a trainer/coach and to continue to reach my full potential in doing so.</p>
                
                <p>I love to find out what makes you blossom and grow, and to find out where there is room for you in order to grow even more into your best self. <a href="mailto:me@merelgeanna.com">Set up an 1 hour free introduction</a> to see how my services can help you realize your dream.</p>
