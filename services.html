                <h2 id="coaching">Coaching</h2>
                <p>As a coach I create a supportive, compassionate and open-minded place where there is room for acknowledgement, appreciation and growth. A place where you can share your emotions, be vulnerable and dream big dreams. In a thought-provoking and creative process, I will help you to take action, to get on the path of making your dream come true.</p>
                <p>Individuals I’ve coached find that they are energized, able to tap into their creativity and one with their passion. They see the small steps that will lead them to where they want to be and feel confident and ready to take action.</p>
                <p>To find out if you want to work with me, <a href="mailto:me@merelgeanna.com">set up a 1 hour free introduction</a>.</p>
                
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>Coaching can take place in real life, face-to-face at a mutually convenient place in the Bay Area, or worldwide, via skype or google hangout worldwide.</p>
                <p>In our first meeting we will find out if I’m a match for you as a coach, we’ll talk about your dreams and what you would like to take home after the coaching sessions. We will also try to make the outcomes you wish for measurable so we will know when you’ve reached your goal!</p>
                <p>If the coaching sessions are sponsored by your organization, the second session will be a meeting with the sponsor, the coachee and the coach (me). This way we can talk about what you want to get out of coaching and what your organization wants you to get out of your coaching.</p>
                <p>The third, fourth and fifth session will each take around 1.5 hours. We will focus on your dreams, skills and strengths. In every session, we will evaluate where you are right now and what you need to reach your potential.</p>
                <p>If the coaching sessions are sponsored by your organization, the sixth session will be an evaluation with the sponsor. This will create a place for sponsor and coachee to catch up and evaluate where we are in the process. The outcome of this session might be to continue with the coaching or it might be that you’ve reached where you want to be!</p>
                <p>In the next session we will talk about how you can help yourself to keep growing, the skills you have learned and the insights you have gained. This way you will be able to help yourself in future situations.</p>
                <p>Six weeks after the coaching ends, we will have an evaluation meeting in which we will talk about what you have taken home from the coaching, what you feel is the added value to your life. In this evaluation meeting we will discuss the hindsight valuation of my services.</p>
                
                <h2 id="training">Training</h2>
                <p>You are unique, your team and company are as well, and so should your training courses be. Using tailor made training courses, I focus on your demands and wishes and work with you towards a sustainable and fast result.</p>
                <p>Together we will discover and define your dream, what you need for your dream to come true and who needs to be involved. You might want to get in sync, put your heads together and make a plan about the future or improve a social skill to achieve your dream.</p>
                <p>You might need a single day of training, a combination of training and coaching or maybe you need a setting that helps your team open-up and get creative. It’s all possible: the goal is to create the best setting to reach your dream!</p>
                <p>By working with the whole system (everybody who needs to be involved) we create a rich and better solution. We’ll work with the strengths and qualities already available in an appreciative, positive and solution-focused manner.</p>
                <p>Together we’ll find out what you want and what kind of training course will suit you best.</p>
                <p>Teams and organizations that I’ve trained feel they know each other on a deeper level, they share the same vision and create and give meaning to their work.</p>
                
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>Training courses can take place at your office, at a mutually convenient place or via skype/google hangout. Together we’ll decide.</p>
                <p>The first step is to meet, in real life or over the phone, and to talk about your dream and how I can help you and your organization in reaching that dream.</p>
                <p>The second step will be about research: through interviews carried out with several individuals in your organization and system, I will learn about their dreams and wishes. Find out when your organization is most alive.</p>
                <p>The third step will be to talk about the outcomes of the interviews. We will talk about which intervention will suit your wishes best.</p>
                <p>With the outcomes of the interviews, the feedback and the conversation about the interventions in my head, I will create a training program that will suit you well.</p>
                <p>The actual training will take place after we talk the program through.</p>
                <p>Six weeks after the training has taken place we will look back on the training and evaluate the outcomes, what it has brought you and what it has added to your organization. In this conversation we will also decide on the hindsight valuation of my services.</p>
