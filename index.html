                <p>Imagine a beautiful tree: its branches reach out to the sky, full with fresh green leaves and sprouting blossoms, its trunk is solid and gracious and through its roots it is connected to the world. Now see yourself as that amazing tree. I believe we can all astound ourselves by being who we really are. We all have dreams and wishes. See them as little seeds. Give that seed positive attention, help it sprout and continue to guide it during its grow, and it will grow into a big, beautiful tree!</p>

                <p>So let’s focus on your dreams: let’s find the seed of your best self. Find out what gives you wings, what makes you blossom and whistle a song. We’ll start with your positive core and together we will explore what makes you grow and blossom as your best self.</p>
    
                <p>Let’s focus on what gives life to you and your organization. When are you most alive, when is your organization most effective, when is your team at its best? You’ll create your future starting with that positive core.</p>
